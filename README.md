# PowerShell Workbench Software Repository

This is a software repository of PowerShell scripts I use for system automation. It is designed to make it easier for developers to automate software management and system configuration using PowerShell

## Usage

To use the PowerShell Workbench Software Repository, you will need to have PowerShell 7 and PSExec64.exe installed on your system.
Once you have PowerShell 7+ and PSExec64.exe installed, you can use any of the automation scripts in this repo to manage local and remote systems and software.

For example, to check your local system for Python and install the latest version of Python from the web, run the following command in PowerShell: `.\06-GetApps-Python.ps1`

## Disclaimer

The scripts contained in this repository are what I use every day to configure systems. They should all work and be free from errors. If you experience any error, please submit an issue and I can help you resolve it.
Some scripts may be specific to my environment and will require modification to work. I try to generalize as much as possible, or prompt the end-user for information at the command line.
All scripts are considered a work-in-progress. I'm always working on adding more metadata and comments.
