# Generative AI and PowerShell

I develop generative AI solutions and use PowerShell in some of my work.

## Background

I practice writing PowerShell by creating a script that performs as a prompt engineering tool. The script helps build a GPT prompt which can be used with any LLM service to generate content.

## Use Cases

Prompt engineering tools are necessary to aid the Prompt Engineer in rapidly developing and prototyping prompts for software engineering use cases.
